[![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-inventory/actions/workflows/ansible-lint-github-hosted.yml/badge.svg)]((https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-inventory/actions/workflows/ansible-lint-github-hosted.yml)) [![Slack Channel](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-channel-tech?logo=slack)](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07TAP5PJ8K)

This repository is intended to contain inventory and all required variables for the ansible automation code in the [RHIS-code](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-code) repository.

The variables and inventory here is just an example basic to deploy the Red Hat Infrastructure Standard (*RH-IS*) [RHIS Code Repository](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-code) framework for using integrated Red Hat technologies to build, manage, automate, optimize, and maintain Red Hat Enterprise Linux at scale in a hybrid multi-cloud.
