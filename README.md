This repository is intended to contain inventory and all required variables for the ansible automation code in the [RHIS-code](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-code) repository.

The variables and inventory here is just an example basic to deploy the Red Hat Infrastructure Standard (*RH-IS*) [RHIS Builder Repository](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-builder) framework for using integrated Red Hat technologies to build, manage, automate, optimize, and maintain Red Hat Enterprise Linux at scale in a hybrid multi-cloud.
